## Conway's Game of Life

Simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in using React. [More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

## Features

- Simulation Speed
- Different Grid Sizes
- Infinite Scrollable Grid
- Cells are simulated even when not in view
- Uses Canvas for rendering because I like pain(and it's fast).
